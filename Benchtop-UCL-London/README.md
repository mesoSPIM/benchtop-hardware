### UCL London version
This version of Benchtop mesoSPIM ([setup #31](https://mesospim.org/setups/)) was modified and shared by [Tchern Lenn](mailto:<y.lenn@ucl.ac.uk>) at the [UCL Cancer Institute Microscopy and Imaging Translational Technology Platform](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cancer/research/cancer-institute-translational-technology-platforms/microscopy-and-imaging-translational). 

The advantages of this modification include:
- 6 laser lines
- alternative NI components for reduced cost

The key changes to the default setup:
- Filter wheel with 8 slots (ZWO EWF 8x31 mm).
- Elevation of the 3D printed detection path components to accomodate larger filter wheel
- NI signal generation card (PXIe-6738)
- NI Terminal block
- NI Card Chassis (PXIe-1090)
- Laser Combiner with 6 lasers

IMPORTANT NOTE!
The new chassis connects to the PC via a **thunderbolt** connection. No special card (eg. PCIe-8363) is needed but an available thunderbolt port on the PC is required.
